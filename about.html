            <h4>Freeman</h4>

            <p>I was born in Illinois and I have lived in a few other states, 
              but I have lived in Iowa since I was about seven years old.  
              Growing up I did a lot of work on the family seed corn farm, 
              which today is an organic farm.  I graduated from Kirkwood 
              Community College with an AAS Degree in Parks and Natural 
              Resources and a Certificate in Entrepreneurship.
